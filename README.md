# System-Analysis-and-Design

# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client was DriverPass, a company looking to offer online lessons and on-the-road driving practice to help new drivers be more prepared for their DMV test. DriverPass wanted an open system where users such as customers and staff members would be able to interact with it and perform different activities.
# What did you do particularly well?
I think I did a good consideration of the functional and non-functional requirements, so I made sure that everything that was said in the interview with the client was properly documented.
# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would probably chose how I wrote the requirements for the interface, I could probably offer more detail to showcase how it should look, or add a sketch like the one the owner of the company made.
# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I put myself into the place of the user (as a customer or staff member) and thought of what I would need from the system to achieve a certain goal, and what could make it easier for me to navigate the system. It is definitely important to consider the user's needs because the product is intended to be used by them, and its whole purpose is to provide a way to achieve an objective.
# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
The techniques I take from this course is creating UML diagrams to showcase the functionality of the system from a certain perspective, to be able to see how it works internally and externally, its behavior and all the processes that occur within it.
